## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to make use of flexbox and css grid and i must say it was challenging, i got to use media query for the first time and i will tell you it was quite hectic.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  !important; To overwrite inline css
}
```
@media ( {
  body {

  }
})
```

### Continued development
